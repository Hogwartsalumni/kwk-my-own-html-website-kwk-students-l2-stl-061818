    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I have many hobbies, ranging from being an entrepeneur to having fun with my friends. <br>I like running my etsy shop and I sell duck tape products and custom TOMS or Converse. <br>I also like playing with my two dogs. I love playing basketball and being active. In school <br>my favorite subject is math and I'm going to be in an accelerated math course. I've also made <br>my own webapp using ruby, html, css, and sinatra.</p>
